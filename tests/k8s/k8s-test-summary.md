# Elemta Kubernetes Deployment Test Summary

## Overview
We've successfully deployed the Elemta application in Kubernetes with three containers:
1. **Elemta** - The main SMTP server
2. **ClamAV** - A mock antivirus service
3. **Rspamd** - Spam filtering service

## Test Results

### Working Components
- ✅ **Elemta SMTP Server**: Successfully running and accessible on port 30025
- ✅ **Mock ClamAV Service**: Successfully running and responding to PING requests
- ❌ **Rspamd Service**: Running but not responding on protocol port 11333

### Connection Tests
- ✅ **SMTP Connection**: Successfully connected to the SMTP server and sent a test email
- ✅ **ClamAV Connection**: Successfully connected from the Elemta container to the ClamAV service
- ❌ **Rspamd Connection**: Failed to connect from the Elemta container to the Rspamd service

## Issues and Next Steps

### Rspamd Issues
The Rspamd service is running but not responding on the protocol port. The logs show that it's starting up correctly, but there might be an issue with the configuration or the service itself. Next steps:

1. Check the Rspamd configuration
2. Verify that the Rspamd service is listening on the correct ports
3. Consider restarting just the Rspamd container
4. Investigate if there's a firewall or network policy blocking the connection
5. Check if the Rspamd service is configured to listen on all interfaces (0.0.0.0)

We attempted to check the running processes and open ports in the Rspamd container, but the container doesn't have the necessary tools installed (ps, netstat, curl). This is expected for minimal container images.

### ClamAV Considerations
We're currently using a mock ClamAV service for testing. For production, we should consider:

1. Using the real ClamAV service with proper memory limits
2. Configuring the ClamAV service to use a persistent volume for the virus database
3. Setting up a cron job to update the virus database regularly

## Deployment Management
We've added the following Makefile targets to manage the Kubernetes deployment:

- `make k8s-up`: Start the Kubernetes deployment
- `make k8s-down`: Stop the Kubernetes deployment
- `make k8s-restart`: Restart the Kubernetes deployment

## Testing Scripts
We've created the following testing scripts:

- `test-k8s-email.sh`: Test the SMTP server and send a test email
- `test-clamav.sh`: Test the ClamAV service
- `test-rspamd.sh`: Test the Rspamd service

## Conclusion
The Elemta Kubernetes deployment is partially working, with the main SMTP server and mock ClamAV service functioning correctly. The Rspamd service needs further investigation to resolve the connection issues.
