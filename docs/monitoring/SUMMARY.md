# Elemta Monitoring Summary

## Components Created

1. **Docker Compose Configuration**
   - Created `docker-compose-monitoring.yml` with services for:
     - Elemta SMTP server
     - ClamAV for virus scanning
     - Rspamd for spam filtering
     - Prometheus for metrics collection
     - Grafana for visualization
     - AlertManager for alerting

2. **Prometheus Configuration**
   - Created `monitoring/prometheus/prometheus.yml` to scrape metrics from:
     - Elemta
     - ClamAV (via exporter)
     - Rspamd
     - Prometheus itself
   - Set up alert rules for critical metrics

3. **Grafana Configuration**
   - Created dashboards for:
     - Elemta metrics
     - Greylisting plugin
     - Security (ClamAV and Rspamd)
   - Set up datasource and dashboard provisioning
   - Configured alerting

4. **AlertManager Configuration**
   - Set up email and Slack notification channels
   - Configured routing based on alert severity

5. **Scripts**
   - Created setup script for initializing the monitoring environment
   - Created security monitoring setup script
   - Created test script for verifying the setup
   - Created load generation script for testing metrics
   - Created verification script for checking the entire stack

6. **Documentation**
   - Updated main README with monitoring information
   - Created detailed monitoring documentation
   - Created security monitoring documentation
   - Created greylisting plugin documentation with metrics information
   - Created this summary of the monitoring setup

## Metrics Implemented

The monitoring system tracks the following metrics:

1. **SMTP Server Metrics**
   - Connection counts and rates
   - Message counts and rates
   - Session durations
   - Error rates

2. **Queue Metrics**
   - Queue sizes by type
   - Queue processing rates
   - Queue age statistics

3. **Delivery Metrics**
   - Delivery attempts
   - Success/failure rates
   - Delivery times
   - Retry statistics

4. **Security Metrics**
   - Authentication attempts and failures
   - TLS usage and handshake failures
   - ClamAV virus detection rates
   - Rspamd spam scores and actions
   - Security scan latency

5. **Plugin Metrics**
   - Greylisting statistics
   - Plugin execution times
   - Plugin-specific metrics

## Alerting Implemented

1. **Prometheus Alerts**
   - High connection count
   - Growing queue size
   - High delivery failure rate
   - High authentication failure rate
   - Large greylisting database
   - High virus detection rate
   - High spam rate
   - Outdated ClamAV database
   - High security scan latency

2. **Grafana Alerts**
   - Configured in dashboard panels
   - Threshold-based alerts
   - Time-series anomaly detection

3. **Notification Channels**
   - Email for critical alerts
   - Slack for warning alerts

## Testing

To test the monitoring setup:

```bash
# Set up the monitoring environment
./scripts/setup-monitoring.sh
./scripts/setup-security-monitoring.sh

# Start the monitoring stack
docker-compose -f docker-compose-monitoring.yml up -d

# Verify the setup
./scripts/verify-monitoring-stack.sh

# Generate test metrics
./scripts/generate-test-load.sh
```

## Dashboards

1. **Main Elemta Dashboard**
   - Overview of SMTP server health
   - Connection statistics
   - Queue status
   - Delivery performance
   - Error rates

2. **Greylisting Dashboard**
   - Greylisting effectiveness
   - Database size
   - Retry patterns
   - Performance impact

3. **Security Dashboard**
   - ClamAV virus detection
   - Rspamd spam filtering
   - Security scan performance
   - Threat type distribution

## Next Steps

1. **Integration with Alerting**
   - Connect to existing notification systems
   - Set up on-call rotations
   - Configure escalation policies

2. **Long-term Storage**
   - Configure Prometheus retention
   - Set up remote storage for historical data
   - Implement data compaction policies

3. **Additional Dashboards**
   - Create role-specific views
   - Develop executive summary dashboards
   - Build troubleshooting dashboards

4. **Metrics Documentation**
   - Document all available metrics
   - Create runbooks for common alerts
   - Develop troubleshooting guides
