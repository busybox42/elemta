# Summary of Package Building Implementation

## What We've Done

1. **Created Individual Build Scripts**:
   - `build_rpm.sh` - For RHEL/CentOS 8 packages
   - `build_rhel9.sh` - For RHEL/CentOS 9 packages
   - `build_debian.sh` - For Debian 11 packages
   - `build_ubuntu.sh` - For Ubuntu 22.04 packages

2. **Created a Master Build Script**:
   - `build_all.sh` - Runs all individual build scripts and provides a summary

3. **Created Utility Scripts**:
   - `check_files.sh` - Checks for required files and creates dummy files if needed
   - `dummy_build.sh` - Creates dummy packages for testing without Docker

4. **Fixed Path Issues**:
   - Updated all scripts to use `../` instead of `../../` for referencing files
   - Used absolute paths where appropriate to avoid path-related issues

5. **Enhanced Docker Commands**:
   - Added proper volume mounting with `$(pwd)` prefix
   - Implemented error handling and log capturing
   - Added cleanup steps to remove temporary build directories

6. **Standardized Version Numbers**:
   - Set all packages to use version `0.0.1`

7. **Improved Documentation**:
   - Updated README.md with detailed instructions
   - Added directory structure information
   - Included installation and service management instructions

8. **Organized Output Directory Structure**:
   - Created specific subdirectories for each distribution version:
     - `dist/rhel8/` for RHEL/CentOS 8 packages
     - `dist/rhel9/` for RHEL/CentOS 9 packages
     - `dist/debian11/` for Debian 11 packages
     - `dist/ubuntu2204/` for Ubuntu 22.04 packages

## Testing Results

We've successfully created dummy packages for all supported distributions:

- RHEL/CentOS 8: `dist/rhel8/elemta-0.0.1-1.el8.x86_64.rpm`
- RHEL/CentOS 9: `dist/rhel9/elemta-0.0.1-1.el9.x86_64.rpm`
- Debian 11: `dist/debian11/elemta_0.0.1_amd64.deb`
- Ubuntu 22.04: `dist/ubuntu2204/elemta_0.0.1_amd64.deb`

## Next Steps

1. **Real Package Building**:
   - Test the scripts in an environment with Docker installed
   - Verify that the packages are built correctly
   - Test installation and functionality on target systems

2. **CI/CD Integration**:
   - Integrate package building into CI/CD pipelines
   - Automate version numbering based on git tags or other versioning systems

3. **Package Repository**:
   - Set up a package repository for distributing the packages
   - Configure automatic publishing of packages to the repository

4. **Additional Features**:
   - Add support for more distributions
   - Implement package signing
   - Add more configuration options
