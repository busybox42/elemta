# Elemta Package Building Implementation Summary

This document provides a summary of how the package building process is implemented for Elemta.

## Build Process Overview

The package building process follows these general steps:

1. **Preparation**:
   - Check for required files (binary, config, data)
   - Create output directories
   - Create temporary build directories

2. **File Organization**:
   - Copy application binary to appropriate location
   - Copy configuration files
   - Create necessary directories for data
   - Create systemd service file

3. **Package Creation**:
   - For RPM packages: Create spec file and build using rpmbuild
   - For DEB packages: Create control file and build using dpkg-deb

4. **Cleanup**:
   - Remove temporary build directories
   - Move final packages to output directory

## Docker Usage

All packages are built using Docker containers to ensure a consistent build environment. This approach has several advantages:

- No need to install build tools on the host system
- Consistent build environment across different systems
- Isolation from the host system

The Docker images used for building packages are:

- `centos:8` for RHEL/CentOS 8 RPM packages
- `rockylinux:9` for RHEL/CentOS 9 RPM packages
- `debian:11` for Debian 11 DEB packages
- `ubuntu:22.04` for Ubuntu 22.04 DEB packages

## Package Structure

### RPM Packages

The RPM packages follow this structure:

```
/usr/bin/elemta                  # Application binary
/etc/elemta/elemta.conf          # Configuration file
/var/lib/elemta/                 # Data directory
/usr/lib/systemd/system/elemta.service  # Systemd service file
```

### DEB Packages

The DEB packages follow this structure:

```
/usr/bin/elemta                  # Application binary
/etc/elemta/elemta.conf          # Configuration file
/var/lib/elemta/                 # Data directory
/lib/systemd/system/elemta.service  # Systemd service file
```

## Service Management

The packages include a systemd service file that configures the Elemta service to:

- Run as the `elemta` user and group (created during installation)
- Start after the network is available
- Restart automatically on failure
- Use the configuration file at `/etc/elemta/elemta.conf`

## Installation Scripts

The packages include scripts that run during installation:

- **Pre-installation**: Check for existing installations
- **Post-installation**: Create user/group, set permissions, enable service
- **Pre-removal**: Stop service
- **Post-removal**: Remove user/group, clean up files

## Future Improvements

Potential improvements to the package building process:

1. Add support for more Linux distributions
2. Implement package signing for enhanced security
3. Add package versioning based on git tags
4. Create repository metadata for easier installation
5. Add integration with CI/CD pipelines
