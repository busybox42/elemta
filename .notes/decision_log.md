## Current Architectural Decisions

### ADR-001: Go as Primary Language
**Date**: [Original project start]  
**Status**: ‚úÖ ACCEPTED  
**Context**: Need high-performance, concurrent SMTP server  
**Decision**: Use Go 1.23+ as primary implementation language  
**Rationale**:

- Strong standard library for network programming
- Good performance characteristics for I/O intensive workloads
- Rich ecosystem for email, authentication, and monitoring

**Consequences**: 
- ‚úÖ High performance and concurrency
- ‚úÖ Strong typing and compile-time error detection
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Learning curve for developers unfamiliar with Go
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Plugin system requires Go build constraints

### ADR-002: Modular Plugin Architecture
**Date**: [Early development]  
**Status**: ‚úÖ ACCEPTED  
**Context**: Need extensible security and filtering system  
**Decision**: Implement plugin-based architecture with hot-loading  
**Rationale**:
- Allows third-party extensions without core modifications
- Enables security features to be optional
- Supports different deployment configurations
- Plugin isolation prevents one component from crashing server

**Consequences**:
- ‚úÖ Highly extensible and configurable
- ‚úÖ Security features can be updated independently
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Increased complexity in plugin loading and management
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Performance overhead for plugin interface calls

### ADR-003: Multi-Queue Message System
**Date**: [Queue system implementation]  
**Status**: ‚úÖ ACCEPTED  
**Context**: Need robust message handling with retry capabilities  
**Decision**: Implement separate queues (active, deferred, hold, failed)  
**Rationale**:
- Clear separation of message states
- Enables different processing strategies per queue
- Supports manual intervention (hold queue)
- Facilitates monitoring and metrics

**Consequences**:
- ‚úÖ Clear message lifecycle management
- ‚úÖ Robust retry and failure handling
- ‚ö†Ô∏è More complex queue management logic
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Multiple queue directories to maintain

## Pending Decisions

### PD-001: Configuration Format Standardization
**Date**: [Current]  
**Status**: üîÑ IN PROGRESS  
**Context**: Currently supports YAML, TOML, and JSON with inconsistent parsing  
**Decision**: [PENDING]  
**Options**:
1. **TOML Only**: Simple, readable, good Go support
2. **YAML Only**: More common, flexible, hierarchical
3. **JSON Only**: Ubiquitous, programmatic generation

**Recommendation**: Choose TOML for simplicity and Go ecosystem alignment  
**Impact**: Requires migration of existing configurations  
**Timeline**: Must decide by end of Week 1

### PD-002: Main Entry Point Structure
**Date**: [Current]  
**Status**: üîÑ IN PROGRESS  
**Context**: Missing `cmd/elemta/main.go` prevents building main server  
**Decision**: [PENDING]  
**Options**:
1. **Single Binary**: All commands in one binary with subcommands
2. **Multiple Binaries**: Separate server, CLI, and queue binaries
3. **Hybrid Approach**: Main server binary + separate utilities

**Recommendation**: Single binary with subcommands (following Go best practices)  
**Impact**: Changes build system and deployment scripts  
**Timeline**: Must implement in Week 1

---

### PD-003: Authentication Production Strategy
**Date**: [Current]  
**Status**: üîÑ IN PROGRESS  
**Context**: Current production code uses mock datasources  
**Decision**: [PENDING]  
**Options**:
1. **LDAP Primary**: Focus on enterprise LDAP integration
2. **Database Primary**: SQL databases as primary auth source
3. **Multi-Source**: Support multiple authentication backends

**Recommendation**: Multi-source with LDAP and database support  
**Impact**: Requires refactoring authentication initialization  
**Timeline**: Must resolve in Week 1

## Rejected Decisions

### RD-001: Python Implementation
**Date**: [Early evaluation]  
**Status**: ‚ùå REJECTED  
**Context**: Considered Python for rapid development  
**Decision**: Rejected in favor of Go  
**Rationale**: 
- Performance requirements favor compiled language
- Concurrency needs better served by Go
- Email protocols benefit from strong typing

---

### RD-002: Single Queue System
**Date**: [Queue design phase]  
**Status**: ‚ùå REJECTED  
**Context**: Considered single queue with message states  
**Decision**: Rejected in favor of multi-queue approach  
**Rationale**:
- Multi-queue provides clearer separation
- Easier to implement different processing strategies
- Better monitoring and operational visibility

## Technical Standards Decisions

### TD-001: Error Handling Pattern
**Status**: ‚úÖ ACCEPTED **Implemented**: 2025-06-21  
**Standard**: Use `fmt.Errorf("operation failed: %w", err)` for error wrapping  
**Rationale**: Enables error unwrapping and stack traces  
**Implementation**: Standardized across all modules with comprehensive error wrapping

### TD-002: Context Usage
**Status**: ‚úÖ ACCEPTED  
**Standard**: Pass `context.Context` as first parameter for all operations  
**Rationale**: Enables timeout, cancellation, and request tracing  

### TD-003: Logging Standard
**Status**: ‚úÖ ACCEPTED **Enhanced**: 2025-06-21  
**Standard**: Use structured logging with `slog` package  
**Rationale**: Better queryability and integration with monitoring systems  
**Enhancement**: Added session IDs, request tracing, and comprehensive context logging

### TD-005: SMTP Session Error Recovery
**Date**: 2025-06-21  
**Status**: ‚úÖ ACCEPTED  
**Standard**: Implement panic recovery and graceful error handling in SMTP sessions  
**Rationale**: Prevents single session failures from crashing the entire server  
**Implementation**: Added defer-based panic recovery with structured logging  

### TD-004: Testing Approach
**Status**: ‚úÖ ACCEPTED  
**Standard**: Table-driven tests with 80%+ coverage requirement  
**Rationale**: Consistent test patterns and adequate coverage assurance  

### TD-006: TLS Security Level Configuration
**Date**: 2025-06-21  
**Status**: ‚úÖ ACCEPTED  
**Standard**: 4-level TLS security configuration (Minimum, Recommended, Strict, Maximum)  
**Rationale**: Provides flexibility for different deployment environments while maintaining security best practices  
**Implementation**: 
- **Minimum**: Basic TLS 1.2+, standard cipher suites (development/legacy compatibility)
- **Recommended**: TLS 1.2+, modern cipher suites, HSTS (production default)
- **Strict**: TLS 1.3 preferred, strong cipher suites, enhanced security headers
- **Maximum**: TLS 1.3 only, strongest cipher suites, comprehensive security measures
**Monitoring**: Real-time TLS connection monitoring with alerting for security events

### TD-007: Queue System Unification
**Date**: 2025-06-21  
**Status**: ‚úÖ ACCEPTED  
**Standard**: Unified queue interfaces with pluggable storage backends  
**Rationale**: Eliminates duplication between SMTP and queue modules, enables clean architecture  
**Implementation**: Interface-based design with storage, delivery, and processing separation  
**Benefits**: Memory optimization, configurable worker pools, atomic operations, hot-swappable backends
