## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards
- All new features must include comprehensive unit tests (target: >90% coverage)
- Integration tests required for component interactions
- Code must pass all linter checks (golint, go vet, staticcheck)
- All public APIs must be documented with examples
- Performance benchmarks required for critical paths

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all business logic
- Integration tests for external dependencies
- Load testing for performance-critical components
- Security testing for authentication and authorization
- End-to-end testing for complete workflows

### Documentation Standards
- API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger specs
- User guides with practical examples
- Architecture documentation with diagrams
- Deployment guides for different environments
- Troubleshooting guides with common issues

## Architecture Decisions

### Current Architecture
- **Modular Design**: Each component is independently testable and replaceable
- **Plugin Architecture**: Extensible system for custom functionality
- **Event-Driven**: Hooks and events for loose coupling
- **Performance-First**: Optimized for high-throughput email processing
- **Production-Ready**: Comprehensive error handling, monitoring, and recovery

### Technology Stack
- **Language**: Go 1.21+ for performance and concurrency
- **Storage**: File-based queues with optional database backend
- **Networking**: Native Go net package with TLS support
- **Monitoring**: Structured logging with metrics collection
- **Testing**: Standard Go testing with comprehensive coverage
- **Documentation**: Markdown with code examples

### Security Considerations
- **TLS Everywhere**: Encrypted communication by default
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive sanitization and validation
- **Error Handling**: No information leakage in error messages
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse and DoS attacks
- **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail of all operations
