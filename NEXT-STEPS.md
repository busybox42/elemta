## Recent Achievement: Enhanced Plugin System ðŸŽ‰

The Plugin System implementation is now **production-ready** with the following capabilities:

### Core Architecture
- **Enhanced Manager** with comprehensive lifecycle management
- **Hook Registry** managing 11 different hook types
- **Plugin Executor** with error isolation and timeout handling
- **Hook Context** providing rich execution context

### Hook Types (11 Total)
- **Connection Hooks** - OnConnect, OnDisconnect
- **SMTP Command Hooks** - OnHelo, OnEhlo, OnAuth, OnStartTLS
- **Mail Transaction Hooks** - OnMailFrom, OnRcptTo, OnData
- **Message Processing Hooks** - OnHeaders, OnBody, OnMessageComplete
- **Queue Hooks** - OnEnqueue, OnDequeue, OnQueueRetry
- **Delivery Hooks** - OnPreDelivery, OnDeliveryAttempt, OnDeliverySuccess, OnDeliveryFailure
- **Security Hooks** - OnRateLimitCheck, OnGreylistCheck, OnReputationCheck
- **Content Filter Hooks** - OnAntivirusScan, OnAntispamScan, OnContentFilter
- **Authentication Hooks** - OnSPFCheck, OnDKIMVerify, OnDMARCCheck
- **Metrics Hooks** - OnMetricsCollect
- **Error Hooks** - OnError, OnRecovery

### Error Isolation & Safety
- **Panic Recovery** - Plugin crashes don't affect main server
- **Timeout Handling** - Plugins killed after configurable timeout
- **Concurrency Control** - Limit concurrent plugin executions
- **Resource Protection** - Prevent plugins from consuming excessive resources

### Monitoring & Observability
- **Execution Metrics** - Total, successful, failed, panic recoveries
- **Plugin Statistics** - Per-plugin performance tracking
- **Health Checks** - Automatic plugin health monitoring
- **Lifecycle Tracking** - Plugin state management and reporting

### Example Implementation
- **Enhanced Security Plugin** demonstrating multiple hooks:
  - Rate limiting with configurable thresholds
  - Greylisting with TTL management
  - IP reputation scoring
  - Connection tracking and statistics
  - Metrics collection integration

The plugin system provides a robust, extensible framework for adding custom functionality to Elemta while maintaining system stability and performance.

## Previous Achievement: Enhanced Queue Manager

The Queue Manager implementation is now **production-ready** with the following capabilities:

### Core Features
- **File-based persistence** with atomic operations and crash recovery
- **4-level priority system** (Critical â†’ High â†’ Normal â†’ Low)
- **Thread-safe operations** with comprehensive locking strategy
- **Real-time statistics** tracking all queue metrics
- **Automatic cleanup** with configurable retention policies

### Advanced Processing
- **Queue Processor** with configurable concurrency limits
- **Smart retry logic** with exponential backoff and jitter
- **Context-aware delivery** with timeout handling
- **Race condition protection** preventing duplicate processing
- **Graceful shutdown** with proper resource cleanup

### Delivery System
- **SMTP delivery handler** with MX record lookup
- **Multi-host fallback** for reliable delivery
- **Domain-based grouping** for efficient batch delivery
- **Connection management** with timeout controls
- **Mock handler** for testing and development

### Monitoring & Observability
- **Comprehensive metrics** (processed, delivered, failed, retries)
- **Queue statistics** (active, deferred, hold, failed counts)
- **Delivery tracking** with attempt history
- **Performance logging** every 5 minutes
- **Real-time status** updates

The queue system is ready for production use and successfully handles message prioritization, reliable delivery, and failure recovery scenarios.
